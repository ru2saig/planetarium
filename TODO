#+TITLE: TODO Planetarium


* Features To-Add
** Positions of the planets like how to sun camera flare is done, as a bright star in the sky?
** TODO Accurate positoins of the planets
** TODO GUI for the planets


* TODO Translations
- Telugu
- Hindi
- etc.
* TODO Clean up/Refactor some of that code. Reread the whole thing, and mark the changes required:
- Not really happy with how a new shader needs to be created for each Planet instance. Make the member variable overloadable? So Earth won't be affected much. Make the shader/model a class? Go with a component architecture, like Unity? Hybrid architecture? Easier to do, and can let the class unload em
- sunLight, make it an instance? But how to remove that colorLoc and ambientLoc parts?
* TODO Use normal maps and specular maps for the shader, use the models as are?
- Convert bump maps into normal maps?
  http://planetpixelemporium.com/mars.html from this website, research into how it's done, and try it!
  But not all the planets have a normal map, they don't make sense for the gas giants. A derived class for that?
  - Need 2 classes, 1 for gas giants, 1 for rocky planets (normal maps)
* TODO think about how moons would work?
